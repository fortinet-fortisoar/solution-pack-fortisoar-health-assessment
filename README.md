# Overview

FortiSOAR is a comprehensive platform designed by integrating multiple applications that seamlessly work together to provide an optimized solution for automation and response management. These applications collectively leverage system resources, with each component contributing to the overall performance and efficiency of the platform. Automation and response functionalities are integral to the FortiSOAR experience, and the platformâ€™s success is highly dependent on effective management of system resources, particularly in terms of the ingestion of records and execution of playbooks.

To ensure optimal utilization and performance, FortiSOAR allows for the tuning of individual applications, enabling the efficient consumption of resources. To support this, the platform provides robust statistical insights into the ingestion rates of records and the performance of playbooks. These analytics play a crucial role in the continuous optimization of FortiSOAR's resource usage.

The solution pack outlined here addresses key use cases aimed at improving resource allocation, enhancing automation workflows, and streamlining overall platform performance:

- **Configuration Recommendation** : To optimise the useage of the resources we provide some confgiuration of multple services that use most of the resources to optimally use the FortiSOAR Resources
- **Health Assessment** : To assess the health of FortiSOAR system we provide some parameters related to playbook and alert module. Here we also provide confgiuration of multiple services to use most of the resources optimally
