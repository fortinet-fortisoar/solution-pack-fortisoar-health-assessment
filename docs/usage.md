# Usage

FortiSOAR Health Assessment can be used in following ways:
- **Usage 1**: Health Assessment
    - Navigate to Health Assessment
    - Click on **Assess System Health**. 
    - A Health Assessment Record will be generated. [Click here](#health-assessment) for more details
- **Usage 2**: Configuration Recommendation
    - Navigate to Health Assessment
    - Click on **Recommend System Configuration**. A Configuration Recommendation Record will be generated. [Click here](#configuration-recommendation) for more details
- Once record is generated you can apply recommendation generated. [Click Here](#applying-recommended-configurations) for step to apply

# Health Assessment
How to read Health Assessment Record
- When you navigate to Health Assessment Record's details view. There will be following tabs
    - **Assessment** : Assessment Tab contains following details:
        - ***System Resources*** : System resources such as vCPUs, RAM, IOPS, and Disk Latency are crucial for determining the overall performance of an application or system.
            - **vCPUs**
            - **RAM** 
            - **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)** measures the speed of disk read/write operations, essential for data-intensive tasks.
            - **Disk Latency** refers to the time delay in accessing data from storage. Lower the latency greater the responsiveness.
        - ***FortiSOAR Information*** :
            - *Alerts Trend : Number of Alerts Ingested* : This metric provides a comprehensive view of the volume of alerts being ingested into the system, helping to track trends and system load over time.
            - *Playbooks : Most Frequently Executed* : Displays the top ten most executed playbooks, giving insight into which automated processes are frequently used.
            - *Playbooks : Most Failing* : Lists the top ten playbooks those fail often, providing a focus area for troubleshooting and improvement.
            - *Playbooks : Running In Debug Mode* : Identifies the top ten playbooks currently running in debug mode.
            - *Playbooks : Most Time Consuming* : Shows the top ten playbooks which take more time for completing the execution, helping to identify performance bottlenecks or areas for optimization.
    - **Recommendation** : Recommendation Tab contains following details:
        - *PostgreSQL* : Database settings for improved performance.
        - *PHP-FPM* :  PHP-FPM settings to boost processing speed.
        - *Workflow Engine* : Fine-tune worker configurations for better task execution and to enhance request handling.
        - *RabbitMQ* : Streamline message queuing to improve communication between services.
        - *SWAP SPACE* : Ensure adequate swap space to maintain stability under heavy load.
# Configuration Recommendation

# Applying Recommended Configurations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is advised to plan **downtime** and  a **VM snapshot** before applying the recommended configuration changes.

You can apply recommended configuration using any of the following methods after connecting to your FortiSOAR™ instance via SSH:
* Using shell commmands
* Manually editing configuration files

Once done, create a swap space. For more information, refer to the [Creating a Swap File](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/managing_storage_devices/getting-started-with-swap_managing-storage-devices#creating-a-swap-file_getting-started-with-swap) section in the Red Hat Enterprise documentation.

### Applying Recommended Configurations Using Shell Commands

> [!TIP]
> We recommend to use this method for applying recommended configuration 

Run the following command to apply latest configuration recommended in Health Assessment record
- `sudo csadm system config --mode optimal`

### Applying Recommended Configurations by Manually Editing Config Files

> [!CAUTION]
> - The system may become unstable if configuration files are not edited properly. Make sure to double-check the changes before applying them.
> - Before editing any file, make sure you have backed up those files.

The section **Recommended System Configuration Based on Assessment** in report or **Recommendation Tab** in record details view, contains parameters to edit for recommended configuration changes. Configuration file's location of each service is as follows and after making the necessary changes, restart the respective service to apply the updates:
- celeryd
    * File Location :`/etc/celery/celeryd.conf`
- sealab_wsgi
    * File Location :`/etc/uwsgi.d/sealab_wsgi.ini`
- integrations_wsgi
    * File Location : `/etc/uwsgi.d/integrations_wsgi.ini`
- PHP-FPM
    * File Location : `/etc/php-fpm.d/cyops-api.conf`
- RabbitMQ
    * File Location : `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf`
- PostgreSQL
    * Verify if the parameter is present in `/var/lib/pgsql/16/data/postgresql.auto.conf`. If it exists, edit this file. If not, proceed to edit `/var/lib/pgsql/16/data/postgresql.conf`



> [!NOTE]
> - For HA setups apply the recommended configuration to all the systems. Restart the services on primary node first then on secondary nodes.
> - If you have updated some parameters in the `/var/lib/pgsql/16/data/postgresql.conf` file and the same parameter is present in the `/var/lib/pgsql/16/data/postgresql.auto.conf` file, the parameter in `/var/lib/pgsql/16/data/postgresql.conf` will be overridden by the one in `/var/lib/pgsql/16/data/postgresql.auto.conf`. Therefore, we recommend using the first method to edit system resources.


# Known Issues
* Irrespective of Global Playbook Logging level settings, playbooks with logging level is set to **Debug** will be counted as **Debug** .
